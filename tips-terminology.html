    <p>One of the most important parts of table tennis is understanding the way the ball spins and how to use this to your advantage. There are three basic kinds of spin to watch out for: topspin, backspin, and side-spin. Spin is created through a method of brushing or skimming the ball instead of making direct contact with it. When brushing the top of the ball, this creates topspin, making the ball fall faster and bounce lower. Backspin, on the other hand, is generated by brushing or ‘cutting’ the underside of the ball, which slows it down and makes it very hard to hit. Lasty, sidespin is created by hitting the ball on the side, which allows it to curve left or right slightly.</p>

    <p>Mastering your positioning and stance is very important in Table Tennis. Begin by ensuring that you have a balanced stance with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and weight distributed evenly on both feet. This will allow you to be able to move quickly when the ball comes your way. Position yourself slightly to the left if you’re right handed (or the other way around if you’re left handed). This allows you to optimise your forehand strokes by giving you more space to use them on the table. While playing table tennis, stay light on your feet, so you can quickly adjust to hit the ball easily. Lastly, maintain a consistent distance to the table, which keeps your shots consistent. Remember, table tennis is all about practice, which will help you get used to the length and size of the table.</p>

    <p>Having your own table tennis racket is very important for players at any level, whether you’re a beginner or long time player. This is because your racket directly influences your performance and playing style. Choosing a racket that is right for you is important because different rackets offer distinct qualities such as speed, spin, and control,  which can significantly influence your play. For example, a racket designed for speed may excel in offensive play, while one with a focus on spin enables players to execute tricky shots with greater precision.</p>
