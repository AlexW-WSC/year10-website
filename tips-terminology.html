    <p>One of the most important parts of table tennis is understanding the way the ball spins and how to use this to your advantage. There are three basic kinds of spin to watch out for: topspin, backspin, and side-spin. Spin is created through a method of brushing or skimming the ball instead of making direct contact with it. When brushing the top of the ball, this creates topspin, making the ball fall faster and bounce lower. Backspin, on the other hand, is generated by brushing or ‘cutting’ the underside of the ball, which slows it down and makes it very hard to hit. Lasty, sidespin is created by hitting the ball on the side, which allows it to curve left or right slightly.</p>
