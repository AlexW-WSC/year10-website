            <p>Table tennis (also known as ping-pong or whiff-whaff) is a racket
            sport derived from tennis but distinguished by its playing surface
            being atop a stationary table, rather than the court on which
            players stand. Either individually or in teams of two, players
            take alternating turns returning a light, hollow ball over the 
            table's net onto the opposing half of the court using small
            rackets until they fail to do so, which results in a point 
            for the opponent. Play is fast, requiring quick reaction 
            and constant attention, and is characterized by an emphasis
            on spin relative to other ball sports, which can heavily
            affect the ball's trajectory. </p>
